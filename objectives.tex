\section{Main Objective}

To investigate the relationship between political-economic alliances and the occurrence of wildfires in Argentina by integrating satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques to systematically detect, monitor, and analyze land cover change, fire patterns, and post-fire land use transformations.

\section*{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{O\arabic*.}]
    \item Detect and quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfires in Argentine provinces from 2001 to the present using satellite-derived fire data (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, FIRMS).
    \item Assess land use and land cover (LULC) changes before and after wildfire events using multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2).
    \item Integrate wildfire occurrence data with political and economic variables at the subnational level to explore correlations and potential causal relationships.
    \item Conduct spatial analysis combining fire data with roads, land tenure, and infrastructure to identify high-risk zones where political-economic interests align with fire occurrence.
    \item Perform case studies in key provinces (Salta, CÃ³rdoba, Santiago del Estero) to validate remote sensing findings and investigate actor-level dynamics.
    \item Develop and disseminate a geospatial database and visual tools (e.g., dashboards, maps) to inform policy, stakeholders, and future research.
\end{enumerate}
